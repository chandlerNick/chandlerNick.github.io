        <h2>Business Intelligence Presentation</h2>
        <p>
          In this presentation, I worked with a team to analyze data from a 2006 AOL search query dataset which we hosted on a VM. We were tasked with augmenting this dataset with an outside source; we chose weather events in the USA during 2006.
          The skills developed in the analysis of these datasets were: SQL, Python, OLAP, ETL, Data Visualization, and Tableau.

        <p>
          In this application, I loaded in data from various government sources about the population and number of charging stations of different PLZ (postal codes) in Berlin. 
          A heatmap overlay of the map of Berlin, subdivided by PLZ is then presented with a filter for number of inhabitants, and a filter for number of charging stations. 
          In the second part of the project, I worked with a Team to implement a demand estimation layer for the map, and a suggestions box which can be filtered by postal code.

        <h2><a href="https://incometaxdataanalyzer.streamlit.app">Income Tax Calculator App via Streamlit</a></h2>
        <p>
          In this application, I used publicly available IRS data <a href = https://www.irs.gov/statistics/soi-tax-stats-individual-income-tax-statistics-2020-zip-code-data-soi>here</a>
          and processed it to find the median income of 
          any zipcode in the United States that is described by the data. The information used to do this was the number of tax returns 
          in each tax bracket and the bracket values themselves. I made the assumption that the income in each bracket rises linearly 
          and therefore used linear interpolation to approximate the median.

              In this project, I built a feed forward neural network capable of classification and regression all the way from the matrix multiplications.
              It was written in python using the NumPy library so that we could deeply understand the mathematics behind neural networks.
