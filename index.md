## About Me

I am a current Master's Student at BHT Berlin in Germany. After growing up in Seattle, WA, USA, I found that technology and specifically software has a large impact on the development of society. This sparked my interest in Machine Learning and more broadly, AI, which has lead me to where I am today. I enjoy learning about how things work and aspire most to build things that have the power to drive the world forward.

In addition to my work in science & technology, I enjoy exploring the world around me via hiking and biking.

If you're interested, check out some of the the [projects](projects.md) I've been working on.
